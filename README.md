# Personal-Webpage-Generator
This program accepts a user's name and a description of themselves as input. It takes the input and converts it into a HTML file called webpage.html. When the file is generated, the program will open it in the web browser for preview. The HTML file is very basic and can be changed for a more complex/pretty design. This program uses webbrowser, os , and urllib.
